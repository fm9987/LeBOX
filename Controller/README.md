For the controller the commands are used so that I get an input from ARDUINO
(make sure it is set to the correct port in the arduino code).

After making sure it's connected to the right one upload arduino code into the
arduino and to test it make it print a new random number every time you press it.

After this go to the python file and make sure you are connected to the right
port, and then you can give it any output you want. Then once you run the python
program it will keep outputting the key you want, in my case rn it's z.
