# LeBOX


In this project we are trying to build a console where we can run retro games using RetroPie,
currently we are working on finding a way to run the simulations on my laptop, once they
are fully operational we will upload everything into a Raspberry Pi and build my
own physical console. And personalized UI using python to choose games and emulator.

Achieved goals:
- Started the project
- Obtained WSL and ubuntu
- Downloaded emulator
- Can Start Games
- The button from Arduino acts as a keyboard key


Future steps:
- Configure UI with python
- Make it possible to open on RasberryPi
- Make input from button usable on WSL


Every time I change something change it with this:
git add .
git commit -m "Your message about what changed"
git push
